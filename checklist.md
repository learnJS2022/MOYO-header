- check your work using basic recommendations [here](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_search-bar-airbnb/blob/master/checklist.md)
- check alt attributes, they must be present ([find out more](https://osric.com/chris/accidental-developer/2012/01/when-should-alt-text-be-blank/) [and this](https://9clouds.com/blog/the-importance-of-alt-attributes-aka-alt-text/))
- logo should be a link to the main page of the website
- use alternative font-family in case the main one doesn't work [like this](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.asp)
- check the demo page with different screen sizes (including those bigger than 1700px)
- do not use overcomplicated media conditions (try to follow desktop-driven or mobile-driven development)
- uppercase letters for navlist are made with styles, not hardcoded into html (you have usual text with first uppercase letter in html)
- links should be with cursor pointer
- are you sure you've polished your code? :)
